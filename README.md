This is a sort of tower defense game where you are a bear defending your cub from hunters by throwing stones at them! You have three lives. Yes I know, so realistic. Let's not talk about the fact that the hunters are also all Elmer Fudd. Every time you let a hunter past the end of the screen, get hit by a hunter, or a hunter reaches your cub, you lose a life. When you lose all your lives, the game ends. The controls of the game are the right and left arrow keys. Press the up arrow key to throw a stone and press p to pause the game. When the game ends, enter your initials (at most 3 letters long) and you might just end up on the leaderboard! Have fun and enjoy "Bear vs. Hunters: Protect your Cub!"
